      "body": "This issue comes up a lot, including during the presentation at IETF-124 and on the mailing list. I'll define in words for now what we mean by cryptographic binding, why we think we need it, how it can be achieved.\n\n## Summary\n\nCryptographic binding between a secure channel (establishment) session and a remote attestation session gives the attester's peer (calling them relying party or RP henceforth) confidence that the secure channel endpoint is the attester. So if the attester has a WebPKI-based identifier, the RP can also trust that the attestation credential (AC) is representative of the entity who owns that identifier.\n\n**Attacker model**: The strongest attacker I can think of is a service provider who wants to pretend that their service resides in a TEE (or another attested environment). They have access to webPKI certs and the associated key material. They can also control the routing of traffic to this service, and can spin up the workloads they want to impersonate in attestable environments. Their only difficulty is in convincing the RP that the AC and the CertificateVerify are coming from the same endpoint.\n\n## Why?\n\nStrong binding is needed to prevent a malicious \"attester\" from just conveying an AC taken from a legitimate TEE as its own - in other words, to prevent a Man in the Middle. Without some sort of binding, the provenance of the AC can't be established, and so the RP should not trust its contents. For example, relying strictly on nonces for this would not be sufficient, since the nonces can just be forwarded to/from separate sessions.\n\n## How?\n\nThis is the crux of the problem and I'm not sure whether we should describe any specific mechanism in this draft, but instead leave it to protocol designers to ensure MitM is not possible.\n\nNevertheless, here are some examples of how to achieve this in the context of TLS in particular:\n\n* Export some keying material from the TLS session and include it in the AC. The RP can verify this binding to confirm the provenance. **Pro**: strong guarantee. **Con**: more complex to implement (?), perhaps going as far as making changes to key schedule.\n* Bind the AC to the attester's webPKI cert (e.g., by hashing the cert, or the public key...). The RP can verify that the AC was issued for an entity who owns that cert, which CertificateVerify proves is the peer. **Pro**: simpler to implement and does not involve invasive changes to secure channel protocol. **Con**: this only works if the webPKI-certified key has never left the TEE / attester; if it was provisioned at runtime, the guarantee vanishes (since the key owner could just use the same webPKI credential from an insecure context).\n* Bind the webPKI cert to the (unique) attesting platform. The RP can verify that the platform identifier from the webPKI cert corresponds to whatever is in the AC. **Pro**: similar to above. **Con**: Similar to above, plus it's only possible if the attester has a unique identity.\n\nMaybe these last two options also point to a tiered approach: you can either do direct binding to session, or binding through webPKI cert AND a new property that the certified key has never left / cannot leave the attester.\n\n## Questions for WG\n\n* Do we need this property? To us it seems critical, but maybe we're mistaken.\n* At what level of detail do we describe it in the draft?\n    * Does it limit the scope of the charter if we go with a lower-level wording?\n* Do we need to perhaps phrase it as a negative property instead? e.g. \"Protocol is not subject to MitM of AC\"",

The CertificateVerify signature also covers the Handshake Context defined in RFC 9261, which is derived from exporter-secret\u2013based values taken from the TLS session. This means the signature is bound both to the webPKI certificate and to the TLS session in which the authenticator is generated. Only the entity that holds the private key corresponding to the webPKI certificate and that has access to the exporter-secret of the session can produce a valid CertificateVerify.\n\nHowever, the binding described above does not by itself prevent a server from obtaining attestation evidence from a different TEE and presenting it as its own. A malicious server that legitimately holds the webPKI  certificate private key and controls the TLS session can export the session-specific exporter values and forward them to a remote TEE, which can in turn produce attestation evidence that verifies correctly inside the Certificate message. To ensure that the attestation evidence originates from the same environment that holds the certificate private key, the attestation evidence will have to include the public key of the webPKI certificate used in the Certificate message, together with claims that the corresponding private key is generated and protected within the TEE.

Instead, the TEE measurements should point to a TLS stack that generates evidence for its own use _only_ through internal means. Basically, the measurements should _never_ get accepted if the TEE can just receive the exporter from some other machine, and just includes that in its attestation evidence. Perhaps this is another property that we need to make explicit.\n\n> the attestation evidence will have to include the public key of the webPKI certificate used in the Certificate message, together with claims that the corresponding private key is generated and protected within the TEE.\n\nI think if the property above holds (evidence contains an exporter value, and can never be generated through some externally-driven mechanism), then this part isn't strictly needed.

Basically, we want the property to be more generic, but to explain and understand it better it makes more sense to discuss concrete examples.",

Operation-Triggered Attestation for High-Impact Application Operations\n\nGoal: Ensure the integrity of application services at operation time, when security posture may change after initial channel establishment.\n\nUse case: High-Assurance Operation Execution in Dynamic Application Services: An application service instance (e.g., AI agent) or confidential computing environment (which could host an AI agent) maintains a (D)TLS connection with a peer and must execute a high-impact action (e.g., payment initiation, configuration change, privileged command).\n\nRequirement 1: Before executing a high-impact operation over the existing connection, the peer must presents fresh, connection-bound attestation evidence reflecting the current behavior-affecting posture (e.g., enabled capabilities, policy configuration, runtime permissions). \n\nRequirement 2: The mechanism SHOULD support lightweight, dynamic attestation within the existing connection, without necessarily requiring a full new TLS handshake, so that behavior-affecting posture changes are visible to relying parties when required by local policy.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAny comment and feedback are welcome to refine the descriptions.\n\n/Yuning",
