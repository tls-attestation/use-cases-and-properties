Anyway, I propose we leave as it is, because it is one of the requirements that our protocol design needs to satisfy. This document -- at least the way I am thinking of it -- is just describing our requirements for protocol design and we agree that it is a requirement. Whether it is deployment-specific or hardware architecture-specific does not matter for this document in my view. \r\nIf we really want to qualify it, we should thoroughly discuss how Arm CCA avoids this and then qualify other properties too.
