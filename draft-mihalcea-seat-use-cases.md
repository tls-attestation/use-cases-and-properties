--- abstract

This document outlines desirable properties and use cases for integrating remote
attestation (RA) capabilities with secure channel establishment protocols (e.g., TLS and DTLS).
Peer authentication in such protocols establishes trust in a peer's network identifiers but
provides no assurance regarding the integrity of its underlying software and
hardware stack. Remote attestation addresses this gap by enabling a peer to
provide verifiable evidence about the current state of the Target Environment. This document specifies a set of essential
properties the protocol solution must have, including cryptographic binding to
the secure connection, evidence freshness, and flexibility to support different
attestation models. It then explores relevant use cases, such as confidential
data collaboration and secure secrets provisioning, to motivate the
need for this integration.  This document is intended
to serve as an input to the design
of protocol solutions within the SEAT working group.

# Introduction

## Establishing Trust in Secure Communications

Secure channel protocols, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS),
primarily establish trust in a peer's identity. This is typically achieved
through mechanisms like a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), where a trusted
Certification Authority (CA) vouches for the binding between a public key and an
identifier (e.g., a hostname).

However, this model has one key limitation: entity authentication provides no assurance about the peer's state, such as the integrity of its software stack at boot time and during runtime.
A compromised endpoint, for instance, can still present a valid X.509
certificate and be considered "trusted" by a client. This gap allows compromised
endpoints to maintain network access and the trust of their peers, posing a
significant security risk in many environments.

## The Role of Remote Attestation

Remote Attestation (RA), as described in the RATS architecture {{RFC9334}}, is a
mechanism designed to fill this gap. RA allows an entity (the "Attester") to
produce verifiable "Evidence" about its current runtime state. This Evidence covers the Attester's TCB and can thus include measurements of:

- firmware
- operating system
- application code
- the configuration of its hardware and software security features (e.g., secure boot status and memory
isolation).

A "Relying Party" can then use this Evidence, often with the help of
a trusted "Verifier", to appraise the Attester's trustworthiness.

Composing RA with a secure channel establishment protocol adds a second
dimension of trust - trustworthiness - to complement peer
authentication. This allows a peer to make authorization decisions based not
just on who the other party is, but also on what it is (e.g., an AMD
SEV-SNP-based server running in some known datacenter) and whether its state is
acceptable.

## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to establish a set of essential properties
for composition of RA with secure channel protocols and to outline the key use
cases that can benefit from such a composition. Most of the use cases presented in this document are provided by industry contributors in the SEAT WG, who have plans to deploy this technology. The initial focus is on
TLS 1.3  {{I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}
and its datagram-oriented variant, DTLS 1.3 {{I-D.ietf-tls-rfc9147bis}}.

This document is intended as an input to the design of protocol solutions within
the SEAT working group. It defines the "why" (the motivation) and the "what" (the requirements),
but not the "how" (the protocol design itself). The "how" part is discussed
in the companion document {{I-D.usama-seat-intra-vs-post}}, which serves as the
glue between this document and the protocol specifications. A key goal of this
document is to define
requirements for a solution that is agnostic to any specific attestation
technology (e.g., Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), Intel TDX, AMD SEV, Arm CCA).

# Terminology

This document uses the terminology defined in the RATS Architecture {{RFC9334}},
including "Attester", "Relying Party", "Verifier", "Evidence", and "Attestation
Results".

This document also uses the following terms:

* Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of a device: see {{RFC4949}}. Note that for this
draft, it includes respective configurations of hardware, firmware, and software.
* Confidential Workload: as defined in {{-wimse-twi}}.
* Measurements: as defined in {{-rats-measured}}.
* AI agent: An AI agent is a software principal (typically long-running) that performs
closed-loop "perceive -> plan -> act" cycles using an LLM or other model,
and invokes external tools/APIs that may read sensitive data or change
system/network state. Its configuration (e.g., model choice, tool enablement,
prompt template) can change independently of the binary/image and usually
more frequently than typical platform TCB updates {{AI-agents}}.
* Infrastructure provider: see {{I-D.sardar-rats-sec-cons}}.
* Diversion attacks: see {{I-D.sardar-rats-sec-cons}}.

# Integration Properties

This section provides a list of desirable properties for designs that compose
RA with secure channel protocols. In general, properties may depend on several
factors, such as the system model, threat model, deployment model, hardware architecture, etc.
Also, some properties may not be met by the existing state-of-the-art.
Proposed protocol specifications should
clearly state which of these properties are fulfilled and explain how.

## Cryptographic Binding to Communication Channel

The Evidence or Attestation Result is cryptographically bound to the
specific secure connection (e.g., the (D)TLS connection). This prevents
**relay** attacks where an attacker presents valid, but unrelated
Evidence from a different connection or context. This binding is paramount for all
use cases because the absence of this binding can be exploited in high-severity
vulnerabilities, such as {{CVE-2026-33697}}.

## Compound Authentication
RA should complement endpoint authentication rather than replace it.
Combining the two security measures would ensure that the introduction of attestation increases security instead of replacing one security measure by another.
A formal representation of this requirement in the form of *composition* goal can be found in {{ID-Crisis}} for TLS 1.3 protocol.

## Cryptographic Binding to Machine Identifier

Evidence should be cryptographically bound to the identifier of the physical machine and the infrastructure provider (owner organization) to prevent **diversion** attacks {{ID-Crisis}}.

The rationale for this goal is that a network adversary can divert the connection from the intended server to any server anywhere running the same software stack in the TEE.
The server could be in a different data center controlled by a malicious entity.

The confidential computing counterargument for this attack is that it does not matter where the connection is established as long as the hardware being attested is secure and the attestation procedure is successful.
However, this argument is based on the strong assumption that no TEE is ever compromised.
Real-world exploits, such as [TEE.fail](https://tee.fail/) and [Wiretap.fail](https://wiretap.fail/), have already proven this assumption to be incorrect.

Hardware vendors, like [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/announcement/intel-security-announcement-2025-10-28-001.html) and [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-3040.html), have declared these attacks as out of scope of their threat model.
Hence, this security goal mitigates the scenario where one compromised TEE in the world may lead to potential compromise of the security of all attested TLS connections.

This security goal is even more important when the cloud service provider is considered malicious, as in the Confidential Computing threat model. In this case, one compromised TEE in the data center can affect the security of all attested TLS connections, since all connections can be diverted to the compromised machine. Without identifier of the physical machine, this attack may not be mitigated.

In state-of-the-art confidential computing deployments today, appraisal of cryptographic binding of Evidence to the physical machine identifier and the infrastructure provider is not supported.

## Attestation Credential Freshness

The Relying Party is able to verify that the Evidence or Attestation Result it
receives was freshly generated by the Attester for the specific RA interaction.
State is
transient, and credentials from a previous RA interaction may no longer be valid.
See
{{Section 10 of -rats-arch}} for more details about freshness in the context of
RA. This is formalized for attestation nonce in  {{ID-Crisis}}.

In all state-of-the-art hardware architectures (Intel, AMD etc.) and deployments today, attestation nonce does not go to the platform level to trigger fresh Claims collection.
Hence, attestation nonce in all deployments today does not provide *real* freshness.

## Negotiation and Capability Discovery

Peers have a secure mechanism to discover each other's support for RA, the
specific attestation formats they can produce or consume, and the attestation
models they support. This enables interoperability and allows for graceful
fallback for endpoints that do not support RA.

## Attestation Model Flexibility

The solution supports both the Background Check and Passport models as defined
in the RATS architecture {{RFC9334}}. The Background Check model is essential
for use cases requiring maximum freshness, while the Passport model is better
suited for performance, scalability, and scenarios where the Verifier may be
offline or unreachable by the Relying Party.

## Interaction with Peer Authentication

The solution supports using RA in conjunction with traditional PKI-based
authentication (e.g., X.509 certificates). This provides two independent pillars
of trust: endpoint trustworthiness (from RA) and identity (from PKI).

## Runtime Attestation

Evidence collected at certificate issuance or during the initial secure channel establishment reflects only the Target Environment’s state at that moment. It cannot guarantee that the Target Environment remains trustworthy for the lifetime of the certificate or even for the duration of the secure connection (e.g., the (D)TLS connection). As a result, such static Evidence is insufficient in environments where the Target Environment may change state after the connection is established and the connection is long-lived.

### Periodic vs. On-demand Attestation
It should be possible for the Relying Party to request new Evidence periodically or on-demand during the lifetime of the connection.
This may be necessary if the Target Environment has attributes that can change during the connection, thereby affecting its trustworthiness. Such changes cannot be detected using Evidence collected earlier.
For example, the Evidence may include dynamic parameters such as runtime configuration flags (e.g., FIPS mode), which indicate whether the device has entered or exited an approved mode, or measurements of critical system files.

## Privacy Preservation

The solution must not degrade the privacy of a standard secure connection (e.g., the (D)TLS connection). Evidence
can contain highly specific, unique information about a device's hardware and
software, which could be used as an advanced tracking mechanism, following a
user across different connections and services. The design must consider how to
minimize this leakage, especially when a third-party Verifier is involved in the
protocol exchange.

## Performance and Efficiency

The introduction of remote attestation should not add prohibitive latency or overhead
to the connection establishment process. To be widely adopted, the solution must
be practical. While some overhead is unavoidable, multiple additional
round-trips or very large payloads in the initial handshake should be minimized.


# Use Cases

This section provides the concrete motivation for the WG's work by describing
specific use cases. For each case, the scenario, actors, and specific security
guarantees needed from RA are described.

## Secure Provisioning and High-Assurance Operations

Goal: Ensure the integrity of workloads and devices when bootstrapping their
PKI-based identity or receiving critical commands.

### Runtime Secret Provisioning

A confidential workload starts in a
generic state and needs to fetch secrets (e.g., API keys, database credentials,
encryption keys) to become operational.

* Requirement: The workload must attest its runtime state (TEE genuineness,
  software measurements) to a secrets management service. The service will only
  release the secrets after successful verification, ensuring they are delivered
  exclusively to a trustworthy environment. This use-case also covers secure
  device onboarding for IoT devices that lack a pre-provisioned PKI-based identity.

### High-Assurance Command Execution

An operator sends a critical command
to a remote system (e.g., an industrial controller, a financial transaction
processor).

* Requirement: The system must provide fresh Evidence to the
  operator to prove its integrity before the command is dispatched. This
  prevents commands from being executed on a compromised system.

## Confidential Data Collaboration

Goal: Enable multiple parties to collaborate on sensitive, combined datasets
without exposing raw data to each other or to the infrastructure operator.

### Data Clean Rooms

Multiple *data providers* contribute sensitive data to
a confidential workload for joint analysis. *Data consumers* receive aggregated
insights without ever accessing the raw, combined dataset.

* Requirement: Before sending data, each data provider must attest the
  confidential workload to verify it is running the authorized analysis code in
  a secure Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Similarly, data consumers must
  attest the workload to trust the integrity of the results.

###Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)

Distributed parties
collaboratively compute a function (e.g., train a machine learning model)
without sharing their local data.

* Requirement: The central aggregator, as well as each participating client,
  must be able to mutually attest to ensure all parties are running the correct,
  untampered MPC algorithm in a trusted environment.

## Network Infrastructure Integrity

Goal: Verify the integrity of network devices that form the foundation of
communication.

### Attestation of Network Functions

A router, switch, or firewall joins
a network's management plane. A Virtualized Network Function (VNF) is
instantiated on a generic server.

* Requirement: The network orchestrator must verify the device's integrity
  (e.g., secure boot enabled, running signed OS and firmware) before allowing it
  to join the network and receive policy. This prevents a compromised router
  from misdirecting traffic or a malicious VNF from inspecting sensitive
  packets.

### Securing Control and Management Planes

An administrator connects to a
network device's management interface.

* Requirement: The administrator's client must verify the integrity of the
  management endpoint on the network device to ensure they are not connecting to
  a compromised interface that could steal credentials or manipulate the device.

## Operation-Triggered Attestation for High-Impact Application Operations
{: #sec-operation-triggered }

Goal: Ensure the integrity of application services at operation time,
when security posture may change after initial channel establishment.

Use case: **High-Assurance Operation Execution in Dynamic Application Services**:
An application service instance (e.g., AI agent) or confidential computing
environment (which could host an AI agent) maintains a (D)TLS connection with
a peer and must execute a high-impact action (e.g., payment initiation,
configuration change, privileged command).

* Requirement 1: Before executing a high-impact operation over the existing
connection, the peer must present fresh, connection-bound Evidence
reflecting the current behavior-affecting posture (e.g., enabled capabilities,
policy configuration, runtime permissions).

* Requirement 2: The mechanism should support lightweight, dynamic attestation
within the existing connection, without necessarily requiring a full new TLS
handshake, so that behavior-affecting posture changes are visible to relying
parties when required by local policy.

## Attestation of Certificate Private Key

A TLS endpoint authenticates itself using an end-entity certificate whose
corresponding private key is claimed to be protected by a secure element.
While standard TLS authentication verifies possession of the private
key, it provides no assurance about where or how that key is stored and used.

In this scenario, the peer acting as the Relying Party requires additional
assurance that the private key associated with the end-entity certificate used
to authenticate the TLS connection is generated, stored, and used within an
attested cryptographic module. In addition to verifying possession of the
private key via the TLS handshake, the Relying Party seeks
Evidence that the key is non-exportable, remains bound to the
cryptographic module, and that the module is operating in an expected
security configuration at the time the TLS connection is established.

Remote attestation is used to provide Evidence about the cryptographic module
where the private key used for TLS authentication is stored. The Evidence may
include claims about the security properties of the cryptographic module.
To prevent replay attacks, this Evidence has to be fresh and tied to the
current TLS connection. Replayed Evidence could otherwise be used to falsely
assert key protection properties that no longer hold.

* Requirement: The Attester must be able to produce Evidence that demonstrates
  that the private key used for secure channel authentication:
  * is generated and stored within a specific cryptographic module or secure
    element,
  * is protected against export or software extraction
  * is attested using fresh Evidence that is bound to the current TLS connection.

The Relying Party uses this Evidence, potentially with the assistance of a
Verifier, to determine whether the key protection properties satisfy its local
security policy.

The approach described in {{I-D.draft-ietf-rats-pkix-key-attestation}} addresses this
use case partially by providing attestation of the cryptographic module and associated
private key at certificate issuance time, reflecting their state when the
certificate is enrolled. This model does not provide guarantees about the
continued state of the module at connection establishment or during the lifetime of
the TLS connection.

## Platform-to-platform communication

Goal: Allow platforms to establish a trustworthy secure channel with each other.

Use case: Migration of workloads (confidential workloads in particular) between
different platforms. Migration is occasionally required in order to maintain
uptime for the hosted services across periods of scheduled downtime for the
hosting platform. Having remote attestation-enforced policies for such migration
events provides guarantees that the services will not be exposed to lower
security guarantees when migrating. Migration is typically performed by trusted,
low-level components (migration agents) on both source and destination
platforms, which perform the authorization checks and handle the data migration.

* Requirement: The migration agent on the destination platform typically acts
  as Attester, proving its state for its peer on the source platform (where the
  workload initially resides).

* Example: Intel TDX offers migration capabilities via its Migration Trust Domain (MigTD)
  {{MigTD}}. Peer MigTDs on the initiating and target platforms set up an
  attested TLS connection to perform the migration over.

## AI Governance and Accountability

Goal: Design framework for governing autonomous AI agents.

Use case: See {{I-D.aylward-aiga-2}} for details. Contrary to {{sec-operation-triggered}}, the entity verifying the Evidence in this case is the governance body and for the purposes of ensuring that no unethical or harmful action is performed.

* Requirement: Runtime attestation based on agent risk tiers defined in {{Section 2.2 of I-D.aylward-aiga-2}}

# Security Considerations

This document describes use cases and integration properties. The security of
any protocol designed to fulfill these properties will depend on its specific
mechanisms. However, any solution must address the following high-level
considerations:

* Replay and Relay Protection: The requirements for cryptographic binding and
  freshness are critical. Failure to bind attestation credentials tightly to the
  current connection would allow an adversary to replay or relay old or stolen, yet
  valid credentials from a compromised system, completely undermining the
  security goals.

* Verifier Trust and Privacy: In the Background Check model, the Relying Party
  communicates with a Verifier. This reveals to the Verifier that the Relying
  Party is communicating with the Attester. Depending on the scenario, this
  could leak sensitive information about business relationships or user
  activity. Solutions should consider mechanisms to minimize the data revealed
  to the Verifier.

* Downgrade Attacks: The negotiation of attestation capabilities must be secure.
  An active attacker must not be able to trick two parties that both support
  attestation into negotiating a connection without it.

* Evidence Semantics: This document does not define attestation appraisal
  policies. However, a Relying Party must be careful when interpreting
  Attestation Results. A "valid" attestation only means the Evidence is
  authentic and correctly signed; it does not automatically mean the underlying
  system is "secure". The Relying Party must have a clear policy for what
  measurements, software versions, and security configurations are acceptable.
